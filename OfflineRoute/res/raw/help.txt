Street can be searched by street's name and/or intersection with other streets. Point of interest can be searched by point's name, point's type, point's distance or mix type+name, type+distance. GPS location can be searched by latitude and longitude in decimal format. When you search street or point by name, VGPS allows Partial Name Search. You can search for a name by input only part of the name. This feature is very useful, you no need to remember street name or point name in full but still can search for it. Viewing search results Once search results display, you can tap on street name, point name or GPS location in the list to view and select context menu apply to that street or that point. About directions (Routing) You can get directions from one location to another. To do this, do one of the following methods: Method 1:* Search for street or point of interest, tap on street or point in the search results list to set the street or the point as start waypoint* Search for street or point of interest, tap on street or point in the search results list to set the street or the point as target waypoint* Select AutoRouting from main menu Method 2:* Move the pointer over a location, touch and hold (long press) on that location to open context menu. Tap on Set as start to set the current pointer location as start waypoint* Move the pointer over another location, touch and hold (long press) on that location to open context menu. Tap on Set as target to set the current pointer location as target waypoint* Select AutoRouting from main menu You can set start waypoint first or target waypoint first; the setting sequence does not matter. You can also mix method 1 and method 2 to set start waypoint and target waypoint. When you select Waypoints from main menu, you will see start waypoint and target waypoint appear in the waypoints list. You can tap on waypoint in the list to view and select context menu apply to that waypoint. After you set start waypoint, target waypoint and select AutoRouting from main menu, VGPS will calculate shortest route or fastest route depend on route settings in Setup menu. Route will appear on the map as a red line. VGPS will automatic guide you along the route with voice guidance. VGPS also displays street name together with estimated distance to target. You can adjust how VGPS calculates shortest/fastest route by changing route settings in Setup menu. There is an option to load routing nodes into phone's memory. If your phone has a lot of memory, you can try to select this option to load routing nodes into phone's memory, VGPS will calculate shortest/fastest route almost immediately (less than 1 second). If you can not load routing nodes into phone's memory because your map is so huge, you can adjust Route Calculation Speed by touch the thumb and drag left or right to set the level of heuristic use in route calculation. If you drag the thumb left, route calculation will be slow but always find shortest/fastest route. If you drag the thumb right, route calculation will be faster but can only find best route that close to shortest/fastest route. The thumb in middle is the optimization heuristic, but you can try to adjust it to find the best level of heuristic for your map. About GPS (real-time tracking) VGPS allows GPS real-time tracking movement. After you select GPS Tracking from main menu, VGPS will enter GPS real-time tracking mode. Press any key or tap on the map again will terminate GPS real-time tracking mode. When in GPS real-time tracking mode, VGPS will automatic move the map according to your current GPS location (latitude, longitude). If you check In Car Navigation When Tracking/Routing option, VGPS will use the phone sensor to detect your orientation and automatic rotate the map so that the facing direction (heading) is always "UP". If you check Keep On Road When Tracking option, VGPS will ignore all GPS locations that are not on the road. Use this option when you drive or walk along the road. If you walk out of the road, you can uncheck this option to see your exact location on the map. About turn by turn navigation You can use AutoRouting together with GPS tracking to have turn by turn navigation. To use turn by turn navigation, follow these steps:1. Increase your phone volume so that you can hear voice guidance.2. Open Setup menu and check "In Car Navigation When Tracking/Routing" and "Keep On Road When Tracking" options. If these options have been turn off then turn them on.3. Define start waypoint and target waypoint, select AutoRouting to calculate fastest/shortest route. After the application starts to demo the route, you can tap anywhere on the map to stop the AutoRouting demonstration. The application remembered your route.4. Select GPS tracking menu and wait for the phone to fix GPS signal. It may take a few minutes to fix GPS signal depending on your phone GPS receiver.5. Mount your phone on the phone handle in your car.6. Drive along the fastest/shortest route, the application will guide you to go straight, turn left or turn right. Follow the turn by turn instructions you will reach the target waypoint. Please use this function turn by turn navigation carefully, always look at the road ahead while you drive instead of looking at the small phone screen to have a safe drive. Custom Point Symbols and Voice Guidance If you want to use your own custom point symbols and/or voice guidance sounds, you can edit .png and/or .ogg files in sdcard/digitalmobilemap.com/res folder. Point symbols are grouped into 2 .png files. Each point symbol is 16x16 pixel image in png format. Voice guidance sounds are in .ogg format.
